# Important note on Rdata (.rda) files

The `.rda` files used in this project were too large to store on GitHub. These files are generated as intermediate outputs of `tnbc-typing-master-script.Rmd` and can be created by running that script. Note that the script will likely take several hours to run on a typical laptop (your runtime may vary).
